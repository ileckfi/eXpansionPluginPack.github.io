eXpansion uses composer to handle all dependencies. Installing/Updating eXpansion is really easy.

First let's check that our composer is well up to date. 
```bash
$ sudo composer self-update
```

This should display something like 
```
Updating to version 1.6.2 (stable channel).
   Downloading (100%)         
Use composer self-update --rollback to return to version 1.4.2
```

Now we can install/update eXpansion, todo so just use the update command
```bash
$ composer update
```

This might take sometime.
